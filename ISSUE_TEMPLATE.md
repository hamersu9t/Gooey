Hello There, Future Issue Creator! 

Gooey has grown far more than I ever expected. It's used by lots of people, lots of platforms, and across lots of different Python Development setups. It can take a bit of context to weed out the strange behaviors that can pop up across environments. In short, if you've found a bug, make sure to include the follow (it's the first thing I'll usually ask for any ways).

 - [ ] OS
 - [ ] Python Version 
 - [ ] Gooey Version 
 - [ ] Thorough description of problem 
     - [ ] Expected Behavior 
     - [ ] Actual Behavior 
 - [ ] A minimal code example -- preferably copy/pastable in the issue itself (less time figuring out how to run your code == more time debugging!) 
 - [ ] Screenshot (if visual quirk) 
 - [ ] Anything else you may think will be helpful 
 

Thanks! ^_^
