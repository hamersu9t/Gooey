# Gooey 1.0.4 Released!

Gooey picked up some cool new widget types thanks to awesome contributions from @NathanRichard and @conradhilley. 

The rest of this release was focused on bug fixes and quality improvements.  


The state of Gooey's test suite and internal code is... bad. Regressions have been an ongoing problem throughout Gooey's releases because of this. Gooey was a hobby experiment that exploded in popularity. It grew organically and frantically since the repo was first made public almost 6 years ago. It always lived as a fun little hobby project in my mind, and quality wasn't at the forefront of my thinking. This has changed over the last few years as Gooey's popularity and usage grew. There's now immense pressure involved in each release. Breaking consumers on a minor version bump feels _terrible_.    


## Upgrading from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4

Translation notice! Yes/No options in confirmation modals are now backed by the language files. Previously, they were fixed to english regardless of the selected language. If the new language options aren't configured for your language, you will now see a translation request in the button label! 


## What's new


### Widgets: TimeChooser

</p>

Usage: 

```python
parser = GooeyParser()
parser.add_argument('--time', widget='TimeChooser')
``` 

@NathanRichard added this one after an excellent deep dive into the complexities of dealing with time inside of WX. See the README for notes on usage. 


### Widgets: ColourChooser

</p>

Usage: 

```python
parser = GooeyParser()
parser.add_argument('--color', widget='ColourChooser')
``` 

@conradhilley brought this one to life. You can now select colors from an awesome little chooser widget.  


### CLI based defaults 

@jschultz added the ability to use arguments passed on the command line as defaults in Gooey.  Enable this functionality by passing `use_cmd_args` to the Gooey decorator. 

```python
@Gooey(use_cmd_args=True)
def main():
    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument('--foo')
```

Now any CLI args you pass when invoking your program will show up as defaults in Gooey. 

```
python my_program.py --foo "hello!" 
```

### Additional features

 - Added option to start Gooey in full screen mode
