* [github](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey)
* [PyPi](TODO)



Runnable demos for all the new features can be found in the [Examples repo](https://github.com/chriskiehl/GooeyExamples).

## Overview:


A lot of focus was put on settling Gooey into a more mature stable project. I've spent a lot of time writing documentation, stamping down cross platform issues / quirks, and making numerous tweaks and additions to enable a smoother experience when packaging Gooey powered application for distribution.    


## What's new

New logo





### Fancy Layout controls!

The main goal of this release was enabling more complex real-world layouts and more customization of Gooey's UI. As of 1.1.0, you now have have control over every color, font, and display status within the application. You can now brand Gooey to your organization's colors, logically group related items under a central heading, and optionally show/hide all the individual components that make up an input widget.


### Menu Bars

Gooey now includes a simple declarative system for creating top level menu bars and items.

The menu option currently supports three flavors:



**AboutDialog**


This is an AboutDialog as rendered natively by your OS. It's a good place to show standard info like version info, descriptions, licenses, etc.. in a standard way across platforms.



**MessageDialogs**


Next up are general message dialogs. You can display any informational text inside of these.



**Link**



Finally, you can create fixed menu items that simply link to external resources, for instance, your site, documentation, pdfs, etc.. 


## Rich Text Controls

Thanks to @NathanRichard, Gooey can now optionally honor terminal control sequences and display Rich Text in the output panel.

## Additional features

* OSX now shows program Icon in Dock 
* `show_error_modal` option to toggle whether or not failures additionally raise alert modals.
* `BlockCheckbox` widget.
* Hyperlinks written to the console appear as such and will launch a browser on click
* `clear_before_run` option lets you control whether or not subsequent program runs start from a fresh terminal or preserve the previous output.
