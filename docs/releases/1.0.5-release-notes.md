## Gooey 1.0.5 Released! 


## Breaking Changes 

* (documentation breaking)`terminal_font_weight`'s public documented API allowed the strings "NORMAL" and "BOLD" while its internal implementation relied on numeric font weights (light=200, normal=300, etc..). The documentation was updated to show the correct usage and a constants file was added to the public API.
